# Whack-a-YODA-game

Though buggy, am still proud I made a simple game when I was learning to code. Made a few of my classmates play it just for fun and get feedback on my art.
Just clone the project and from the project folder open the index.html with your favourite browser and get ready to hammer Yodas 😂😂 I guess this
made me all in love with Yodas enough to change my profile picture in guthub to one of their own.

MADE WITH LOTS OF ❤
